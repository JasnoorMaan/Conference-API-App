It was also a time to implement the recommendations of the Kothari Education Commission Report of 1964/6.  What followed was a concurrence of some of the leading unaided recognized schools in the capital to establish an association of privately managed recognized schools so that collective action could be taken on some of the vital issues affecting their functioning keeping the Constitution of Indian Public Schools Conference as a guide, a committee was drawn up.",
